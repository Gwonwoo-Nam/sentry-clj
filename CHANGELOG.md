# Change Log

## Upcoming

* 3.0.next in progress

## Stable Builds

* 3.0.0 -- 2020-09-04
  * Major release bringing compatibility with version 3.0.0 of the Java Sentry
    library. This is a **BREAKING** change, insofar that this has only been
    tested with the latest Sentry (20.9.0) and is **not** compatible with
    Sentry 10.0.1 and below. If you wish to use those versions, please
    continue to use sentry-clj 0.7.2.
